# Directed Graph Implementation (python)

This project implements a directed graph using a dictionary to store vertices and their edges. It supports basic graph operations and provides an interactive command-line menu.

## Features
- **Graph Operations:** Add/remove vertices and edges.
- **Graph Queries:** Check edge existence, retrieve inbound/outbound edges, and calculate vertex degrees (total, in, out).
- **Random Graph Generation:** Create a random graph with a specified number of vertices and edges.
- **Display:** Print the graph as a list of neighbors.
- **Copy:** Deep copy of the graph.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script from the command line:
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
